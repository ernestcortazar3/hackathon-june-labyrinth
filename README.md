Welcome to our group project repository! This is our collaborative space to build something awesome together while learning GitHub and version control. None of us are expertsâ€”yet! This guide will help us stay organized and on the same page.

## Project Overview

**Project Goal:**  
We are going to create a virtual labyrinth full of puzzles and other misc. obstacles for the user to experience a fun escape room challenge. Each room will give the user an item to use to open the next door in the labyrinth.

## GitHub WORKFLOW

GitHub pull, start of workflow:

> git checkout main

- moves HEAD (working branch) to LOCAL main

> git pull origin main

- Pulls most up-to-date changes from Remote to Local

> git checkout -b <unique-branch-name>

- Creates a new branch, names the branch, and moves HEAD to the new creation.

> edits and stuffs

- When finished working:

> git add .

- ques up the changes made.

> git commit -m "Unique message here"

- Creates a snap shot of your code in that moment as it is.

> git pull origin main

- makes sure that you are pushing up the most recent version.
- If there are any merge conflicts, resolve, then "git add ." and "git commit" again the FIX: Merge conflicts.

> git push origin <unique-branch-name>

- Sends the last commit to the Remote Branch

- Create PR (GitHub.com)

  - Merges <unique-branch-name> into the main branch.

- Branch then can be deleted.
